## Learning Objective: 

Today you learned about scopes, woot woot! You are now about 50% of the way there toward becoming a JavaScript master!

The exercises in this section may seem easy, but don't be deceived - they are tricky because scope is a tough thing to conceptualize even though it seems straight forward.

You will start with a warm up, function.js, and end with scopes.js.

You have probably noticed that there are no tests this time around! We haven't given up on them, tests are here to stay

We like to mix it up though - and when you're out there in the wild tests won't be as easy to find as we've made it seem. 

Today is about getting used to roaming without a safety net, as well as solidifying our understanding of Scopes.

Enjoy!
